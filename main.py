Hi [Recipient Name],

I hope you‚Äôre doing well. I recently applied for the Software Development Engineer I position at UPS and wanted to take a moment to express my enthusiasm for the opportunity. Given my background in backend development, distributed systems, and cloud technologies, I believe I would be a strong fit for this role.

I recently completed my Master of Science in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton (GPA: 3.8/4.0) in May 2025. My coursework in Advanced Algorithms, Cloud Computing, and Advanced Database Systems has equipped me with a strong foundation in building scalable, high-performance applications.

Why I am a good fit for this role:

- Developing backend microservices using Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL, improving system scalability and reducing latency by 25%.
- Building event-driven architectures with Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ, optimizing real-time message streaming and handling high-throughput data.
- Implementing CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes, ensuring seamless automated deployments with zero downtime.
- Monitoring system performance using Grafana, reducing incident resolution time by 65%.
- Optimizing data processing pipelines with Spark and Cassandra, cutting computation times by 50% for large datasets.

I‚Äôm eager to bring my expertise in Java, distributed computing, and cloud-based optimizations to UPS‚Äô Operations Research group, contributing to the development of highly scalable and efficient software solutions. I would love the opportunity to further discuss how my skills align with your team‚Äôs goals.

Please let me know if there‚Äôs a convenient time for a conversation. Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,
