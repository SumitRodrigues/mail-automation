Hi [Recipient Name],

I hope you‚Äôre doing well! I recently applied for the Software Engineer (NJUS) position at NetJets Services, Inc. and wanted to express my enthusiasm for this opportunity.

I am currently pursuing my Master‚Äôs in Computer Science at California State University, Fullerton, graduating in May 2025, and have hands-on experience in full-stack development, cloud computing, and scalable software solutions. With over two years of experience in Java, Spring Boot, React.js, and AWS, I have built and optimized enterprise-level applications, automated deployment pipelines, and developed robust APIs to enhance system performance.

Here‚Äôs how my experience aligns with this role:
- Backend Engineering: Developed and optimized microservices using Java, Spring Boot, and Hibernate, improving system performance and API efficiency.
- Cloud & DevOps: Worked with AWS (Lambda, S3, EC2) and Azure, deploying scalable applications and integrating CI/CD pipelines for seamless deployments.
- Frontend & UI Performance: Built React + TypeScript applications with state management (Redux), optimizing UI responsiveness and multi-browser compatibility.
- Agile & Testing: Implemented unit and integration tests (JUnit, Jest, Cypress) to ensure reliability and enhance software quality in Agile environments.

I am incredibly excited about the opportunity to contribute to NetJets‚Äô software solutions for private aviation. If you are the right person to connect with, I would love to discuss how my experience aligns with your engineering needs. Otherwise, I would greatly appreciate it if you could forward my profile to the appropriate hiring manager or recruiter for this role.

Would you be available for a quick call this week? Looking forward to hearing from you

Best regards,
