Hi [Recipient Name],

I hope this email finds you well! I‚Äôm a Software Engineer Student Assistant at California State University, Fullerton, studying Computer Science, and currently preparing to recruit for full-time software engineering positions. I‚Äôm passionate about building scalable distributed systems and leveraging real-time data pipelines to drive efficient decision-making.

Here‚Äôs a little more about me:

- Work Experience: I‚Äôve worked on full-stack applications using Node.js, TypeScript, React.js, and PostgreSQL, developing optimized microservices and implementing event-driven architectures with Kafka. Previously, I worked at BNP Paribas, where I helped design high-performance distributed systems for fintech applications.
- On-Campus Involvement: At CSUF, I have contributed to modernizing CI/CD workflows, migrating legacy infrastructure to AWS, and improving developer productivity by automating deployment pipelines.
- Personal Interests: Outside of coding, I enjoy hiking, experimenting with home automation projects, and staying up to date on the latest cloud computing advancements.

I‚Äôm preparing to apply for the Software Engineer (Fullstack) role at RudderStack this spring and would appreciate the opportunity to ask you a few specific questions about the role and your experience. Would you be available for a quick 15-minute chat at [Insert Specific Time]?

Thanks so much in advance for your time!

Best regards,
