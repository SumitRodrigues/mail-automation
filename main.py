Hi [Recipient Name],

I hope you're doing well! I recently applied for the Software Engineer position at athenahealth and wanted to express my enthusiasm for this opportunity.

A bit about me:

- Full-Stack Development: Experience building scalable applications using Java, Spring Boot, and React.js, optimizing system responsiveness and efficiency.
- Backend & API Development: Designed and integrated RESTful APIs and PostgreSQL, improving request handling throughput by 40%.
- Cloud & DevOps Expertise: Worked with AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda), Docker, and Kubernetes, streamlining deployments and reducing system downtime.
- CI/CD & Agile Workflow: Automated Jenkins-based pipelines, enhancing software delivery speed and ensuring high code quality.
- Frontend Optimization: Developed React.js dashboards and optimized Redux state management, improving UI performance for fintech applications.

I am currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at California State University, Fullerton, and will be graduating in May 2025. Given my passion for building robust healthcare solutions, I would love to bring my skills to athenahealth and contribute to its mission of delivering sustainable, high-quality healthcare.

Would you be available for a quick chat to discuss how my background aligns with your team‚Äôs needs? Also, if you're not the right contact, I‚Äôd greatly appreciate it if you could direct me to the appropriate hiring manager.

Looking forward to your response!

Best regards,
