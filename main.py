Here‚Äôs how my skills align with the role:
- Backend Development: Experience in Java and Spring Boot, building scalable microservices and automating deployments using CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins and Docker.
- Frontend Expertise: Developed dynamic and interactive React.js and TypeScript applications, implementing best UI/UX practices to improve performance.
- Cloud & API Development: Built and integrated RESTful APIs and GraphQL services on AWS Lambda and S3, optimizing data retrieval and reducing latency.
- Automation & Testing: Hands-on experience with Jest, Mocha, Selenium, and Postman, ensuring robust application performance.

I am excited about the prospect of working at Ticketmaster to contribute to building a seamless and secure Accounts and Authentication system. If you are the right person for this role, I would love to connect and discuss my qualifications further.
