Hi [Recipient Name],

I hope you're doing well! I recently applied for the Software Engineer II role at Zebra Technologies (Job ID: 107808) and wanted to follow up on my application. I am very excited about this opportunity, as my background in backend development, cloud computing, and troubleshooting SaaS solutions aligns well with the role‚Äôs requirements.

- Job Link: https://zebra.eightfold.ai/careers?pid=343623588121

I am currently pursuing my Master‚Äôs in Computer Science at California State University, Fullertonion. My experience includes:

- Developing scalable microservices and RESTful APIs using Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL, ensuring high availability and performance for cloud-based applications.
- Deploying and managing SaaS solutions on AWS & Google Cloud (AlloyDB, GKE), optimizing database query performance and ensuring seamless scalability.
- Troubleshooting and resolving API failures and infrastructure bottlenecks using Datadog and distributed tracing, reducing incident resolution times by 60%.
- Implementing real-time event streaming services with WebSockets and Kafka, enhancing low-latency communication for collaboration and push-to-talk systems.
- Automating CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Terraform, ensuring zero downtime deployments for enterprise applications.

With my strong foundation in backend development, SaaS troubleshooting, cloud architecture (AWS, GCP), and real-time communication technologies, I am eager to contribute to Zebra‚Äôs next-generation SaaS collaboration and communication platform.

Would you be open to a quick chat regarding my application? 

Looking forward to hearing from you!
