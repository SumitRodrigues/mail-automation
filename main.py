Hi [Recipient Name],

I hope you're doing well! I recently applied for the Software Engineer (Backend) - Evergreen position at Rakuten and wanted to follow up on my application. I am very excited about this opportunity, given my strong background in backend development, microservices architecture, and cloud infrastructure.

I am currently pursuing my Master‚Äôs in Computer Science at California State University, Fullerton, with an expected graduation in May 2025. My academic and professional experiences have equipped me with:

- Developing and maintaining scalable RESTful APIs & microservices using Java (Spring Boot), Python (FastAPI), and Node.js for high-traffic applications.
- Building event-driven architectures with Kafka, Redis, and PostgreSQL, ensuring real-time processing and system scalability.
- Working with cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Kubernetes, deploying secure and efficient backend solutions.
- Automating CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, Terraform, and GitHub Actions, reducing deployment times and improving infrastructure reliability.

I am particularly drawn to Rakuten‚Äôs emphasis on innovation in e-commerce and rewards and would love the opportunity to contribute to scalable backend solutions that enhance user engagement. If there are any additional materials or details I can provide, I‚Äôd be happy to do so.

Would you be open to a quick chat regarding my application? 

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
