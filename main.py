Hi [Recipient Name],

I hope you’re doing well! I recently applied for the Software Engineer role at DocuSign and wanted to take a moment to express my enthusiasm for this opportunity.

I am currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at California State University, Fullerton, graduating in May 2025, and have a strong background in building scalable cloud-native applications, integrating APIs, and optimizing distributed systems. Here’s how my skill set aligns with this role:

- Frontend Development: Developed dynamic, user-friendly React + TypeScript applications, leveraging Redux, Tailwind CSS, and Jest for UI state management and testing.
- Backend & API Development: Designed and deployed RESTful & GraphQL APIs using Node.js, Nest.js, and Spring Boot, reducing redundant API calls by 85%.
- Cloud & DevOps: Built and deployed microservices on AWS Lambda, S3, and Kubernetes, ensuring high availability and scalability.
- Distributed Systems & Performance Optimization: Implemented Kafka-based event-driven systems and Redis caching, optimizing API response time and system reliability.
- Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC): Hands-on experience with CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions), unit/integration testing, and security best practices.

I’m particularly excited about DocuSign’s mission and its emphasis on secure, scalable software solutions. I would love the opportunity to discuss how my experience can contribute to your team’s success.

If you’re the right person to speak with, I’d greatly appreciate the chance to connect. Otherwise, I’d be grateful if you could kindly forward my profile to the hiring manager for this role.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,
