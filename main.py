Hi [Recipient Name],

I hope you're doing well! I recently applied for the Software Engineer III position at Walmart Global Tech and wanted to express my enthusiasm for this opportunity. 

Here’s a bit about my experience:

- Backend Development: Built and optimized microservices with Java, Spring Boot, and Hibernate, reducing API latency by 25%.
- Cloud & Scalability: Developed and deployed large-scale applications using AWS Lambda, S3, and Kubernetes, improving system efficiency.
- Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA): Designed and integrated RESTful and GraphQL APIs, reducing redundant data calls by 85%.
- Frontend Expertise: Built React + Node.js applications with state management (Redux) and optimized UI performance for millions of users.
- CI/CD & DevOps: Automated deployments with Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes, cutting deployment time from 4 hours to 20 minutes.

I would love the opportunity to discuss how my skills align with Walmart’s engineering needs. Would you be available for a quick chat this week?

Looking forward to hearing from you!  

Best regards,
