Hi [Recipient Name],

I hope this email finds you well! I‚Äôm a Computer Science student graduating in December 2025 and currently preparing to recruit for Software Engineer Intern positions. I am passionate about leveraging technology to build efficient, scalable solutions that drive impactful change‚Äîespecially in industries like renewable energy.

Here‚Äôs a little more about me:

- Full-Stack Development: Developed and deployed React.js and Node.js applications, implementing RESTful APIs and GraphQL to optimize backend efficiency.
- Cloud & DevOps: Worked with AWS services (Lambda, EC2, S3, RDS), CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes), and infrastructure automation to streamline deployments.
- Database Management: Optimized SQL queries for real-time analytics, improving data retrieval performance in large-scale applications.
- Passion for Renewable Energy: Excited about Solar Landscape‚Äôs mission to democratize clean energy access and eager to contribute through innovative software solutions.

I‚Äôm preparing to apply for the Software Engineer Intern role at Solar Landscape this summer and would appreciate the opportunity to ask you a few specific questions about the role and your experience. Would you be available for a quick 15-minute chat this week?

Thanks so much in advance for your time!

Best regards,
