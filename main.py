- Testing & Security: Implemented Spring Security with OAuth2 and conducted unit testing with JUnit & Postman, ensuring secure and stable deployments.

I‚Äôm currently pursuing my Master‚Äôs in Computer Science at California State University, Fullerton, and will graduate in December 2025. I would love the opportunity to discuss how my skills align with AppLovin‚Äôs engineering team and how I can contribute to building high-performance, scalable applications.

If you're the right contact, I‚Äôd appreciate the chance to connect. Otherwise, I‚Äôd be grateful if you could point me in the direction of the hiring manager.
