Hi [Recipient Name],

I hope you're doing well! I recently applied for the Software Engineer position at UKG and wanted to express my strong interest in this opportunity. I am graduating with my Master‚Äôs in Computer Science in May 2025 and have been actively working with Java, JavaScript, React.js, and Spring Boot to develop scalable applications for finance and enterprise systems.

Here‚Äôs how my skills align with this role:

- Full-Stack Development: Built and optimized microservices using Java, Spring Boot, and React.js, delivering high-performance applications in banking and fintech sectors.
- Cloud & DevOps: Worked with AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, and Docker to enhance application scalability, performance, and deployment automation.
- API & Database Management: Designed RESTful and GraphQL APIs, improving backend efficiency while managing large-scale databases (SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- CI/CD & Agile Workflow: Automated Jenkins-based CI/CD pipelines, reducing deployment time by 80% and improving code release frequency.

I would love to discuss how my experience aligns with UKG‚Äôs vision and explore how I can contribute to your engineering team. Please let me know if we can schedule a quick chat. Also, if you‚Äôre not the right person for this role, I‚Äôd greatly appreciate it if you could forward my profile to the appropriate hiring manager.

Looking forward to your response!

Best regards,
