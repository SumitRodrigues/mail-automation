Hi [Recipient Name],

I hope you're doing well! My name is Sumit Rodrigues, and I‚Äôm currently pursuing my Master‚Äôs in Computer Science at California State University, Fullerton. I recently applied for the Software Development Engineer I position at Yardi in Santa Barbara, CA, and wanted to follow up to express my strong interest in the role and see if you might be able to help ensure my application reaches the appropriate team.

A bit about me:

I bring over 2 years of experience in full-stack development with a strong foundation in Java, Spring Boot, Angular, and MySQL. At CSUF, I currently serve as a Web Developer Student Assistant, where I‚Äôve led the integration of ChatGPT-4o for student support, developed responsive Angular components from Figma designs, and enhanced real-time data handling with robust API integrations. Previously, at BNP Paribas, I worked on fintech microservices, optimized real-time dashboards using Angular and D3.js, and automated CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes.

I‚Äôd be grateful for the opportunity to connect and discuss how I could contribute to Yardi‚Äôs innovative development efforts. If possible, could you kindly review my profile or help direct my application to the right team?

Looking forward to hearing from you!
