Hi [Recipient Name],

I hope you're doing well! I recently applied for the Software Engineer II position at Chewy and wanted to express my enthusiasm for the opportunity. With 4+ years of experience in full-stack development, I believe my expertise in React.js, Java, Spring Boot, and scalable microservices aligns well with the role.

At BNP Paribas, I led the transition of a multi-page fintech system to a high-performance React.js & Next.js application, reducing load times by 50%. I also developed real-time dashboards using React and D3.js to help financial analysts visualize large datasets efficiently. Additionally, I built and optimized Java Spring Boot services, implementing robust CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins and Docker to cut deployment time by 80%. My work in AWS, RESTful API development, and performance optimization could directly contribute to Chewy‚Äôs mission of delivering a seamless customer experience.

I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss how my background fits within your team. If my profile aligns with the role, I‚Äôd love for you to evaluate my application or forward it to the hiring team.

Looking forward to your response.
