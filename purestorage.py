Hi [Recipient Name],

I hope you're doing well! I recently came across the Software Engineer Grad position at Pure Storage in Santa Clara and was excited to apply. I am highly interested in this role, given Pure Storage‚Äôs focus on optimizing data infrastructure and delivering high-performance storage solutions.

With my background in C++ development, distributed systems, and performance optimization, I believe I can contribute meaningfully to your team. At BNP Paribas, I worked on optimizing high-frequency data pipelines using C++ and multithreading, improving data retrieval speeds by 40%. Additionally, I have hands-on experience in Linux systems, containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), and memory-efficient algorithms, which aligns well with Pure Storage‚Äôs emphasis on optimizing data replication and storage solutions.

I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss how my background fits within your team. If my profile aligns with the role, I‚Äôd love for you to evaluate my application or forward it to the hiring team.

Looking forward to your response.
