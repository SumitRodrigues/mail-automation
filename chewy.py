Hi [Recipient Name],

I hope you're doing well! My name is Sumit Rodrigues, and I‚Äôm currently pursuing my Master‚Äôs in Computer Science at California State University, Fullerton. I recently applied for the Software Engineer I position at Chewy in Boston, MA via a referral, and I wanted to follow up to express my enthusiasm for the role and see if you could help ensure my application reaches the right team.

A little about me‚ÄîI have 2+ years of experience in full-stack development using Python (FastAPI, Flask), React, and PostgreSQL. In my current role as a Web Developer Student Assistant at CSUF, I built AI-powered chatbot integrations using Python NLP libraries and developed full-stack applications to enhance system performance. Previously, at BNP Paribas, I worked on Python-based microservices, built real-time dashboards using React and D3.js, and optimized deployment pipelines with Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes.

I would love the opportunity to discuss my application further. If possible, could you kindly review my profile or forward my application to the hiring team? 

Looking forward to your response!
