Hi [Recipient Name],

I hope you're doing well. I recently applied for the Associate Software Engineer position at Kargo in Los Angeles, CA, and I wanted to express my enthusiasm for the opportunity. Given Kargo’s focus on interactive ad experiences and high-performance media solutions, I believe my expertise in JavaScript (TypeScript, ES6), React, and RESTful API development aligns well with the role.

Job Link: https://www.kargo.com/careers?gh_jid=4667721007

At California State University, Fullerton, I managed a digital advertising analytics pipeline integrating Google Ads API, DV360, Carrousel, and SQL, overseeing real-time data ingestion and performance tracking. My experience optimizing React.js dashboards with Redux and implementing efficient API interactions can directly contribute to Kargo’s goal of building engaging, high-performance digital experiences. Additionally, my exposure to A/B testing-driven UI enhancements and browser performance optimizations would help create seamless and visually compelling ads.

I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss how my background fits within your team. If my profile aligns with the role, I’d love for you to evaluate my application or forward it to the hiring team.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
